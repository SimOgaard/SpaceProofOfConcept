### Concept:
Send downsampled satellite images and upscaling them down on earth to utilize restricted bandwith of satellites.

Swarm-learning or federated-learning methods could be used to train these neural networks since training data of both these methods only requires downscaling images and can thus be performed on the satellite at the edge.

### Implementation:
1. Treat given SPoC dataset as images taken directly from the satellite.
2. Downsample image by dropping random pixels.
3. Send downsampled image and upscale it on earth based system. 

### Results:
To be implemented and tested.
