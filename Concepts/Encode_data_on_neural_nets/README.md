### Concept:
Encode satellite images on neural nets by overfitting. Sending the neural net holding the encoded image back to earth.
However: State-of-the-art neural network based image compression can not in its current state outperform conventional state-of-the-art image compression methods. But systems like these could be used in the future when more research has been done in the area.

### Implementation:
1. Treat given SPoC dataset as images taken directly from the satellite.
2. Encode images on a neural network [following this approach.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03567.pdf) 

### Results:
To be implemented and tested.
